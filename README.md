#### Overview:

In this project, the purpose is to analyses data from Airbnb rental in Sydney to provide market advice to hosts, real estate investors, and other stakeholders.To develop a predictive model for the daily prices of Airbnb rentals based on state-of-the-art techniques from statistical learning.  This model will and allow the company to advise hosts on pricing and to help owners and investors to predict the potential revenue of Airbnb rental 

#### Supervised Learning Requirement:

* Provide the validation (i.e. Public Leaderboard) scores for at least five different  sets  of  predictions,  including  your  final  model
* At least one of your models should be an advanced nonparametric model (bagging, random forests, boosting, or a model that contains one of these three as a part).
* Create text-based features as part of feature engineering.  

#### Code Outline:

1.Introduction: write a few paragraphs stating the business problem, summarising your final solution, and highlighting your key insights.

 
2.Data processing and exploratory data analysis: provide key information about the data, discuss potential issues, and highlight interesting facts that are useful for the rest of your analysis. Due to lack your space, you may want to refer to the appendix for most EDA plots.  


3.Feature engineering.  


4.Methodology: here you will focus on the two models as outlined above (your rationale for choosing the models and why they make sense for the data, description of how these models are fitted, interpretations of the models in the context of the business problem at hand).  This part is allowed to be more technical than the rest of the report.


5.Predictive model validation.

# Times Series Prediction 



Backgroundand DatasetThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployeddivided by the number ofpeople inthe civilian labor force. The unemployment rate is reported by the relevant government agency in most countries. The unemployment ratecan be used asan importantindicator by the central bank of the country to determine the health of the economy when setting monetary policy. Also investors use unemployment statisticsto plan future operating activities, see https://www.thebalance.com/unemployment-rate-3305744. For this project, we have obtained the historical and current unemployment rates in a country from January 1986 to December 2018. The data have been deliberately added noises to de-identifythe  country. The  dataset UnemploymentRateJan1986-Dec2018.csvcan  be downloaded from the Canvas.The dataset shall contain information of month-year andunemployment rates. Similarly a test dataset  file  of  2019  unemployment  rate,  named UmemploymentRate2019.csvin  the same format, has been hidden from you. They will be used to assess the prediction errors of your  produced  model(s).Your  work  in  this  project  is  to  analyze  the  time  series  of unemployment rates.
